# churchfathers - An interactive timeline to explore the history of the Christian Church

## About this project

This projects sets out to present the Church Fathers and their writings in an interactive timeline.
It is powered by React and uses a lightweight [GraphOL-CMS](https://github.com/sarkistlt/graphql-auto-generating-cms) to store content.
It leverages the top-notch tooling of [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate.git)

## Get going

Run `npm run setup` to install dependencies and clean the git repo.<br />
*We auto-detect `yarn` for installing packages by default, if you wish to force `npm` usage do: `USE_YARN=false npm run setup`*<br />
*At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`.*
