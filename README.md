## About this project

This projects sets out to present the Church Fathers and their writings in an interactive timeline.
It is powered by React and uses a lightweight [GraphOL-CMS](https://github.com/sarkistlt/graphql-auto-generating-cms) to store content.
It leverages the top-notch tooling of [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate.git)

The manuscript history and canonization of the new testament documents and the pre-christian Judaic writings such as those of Philo are not within the initial scope.
